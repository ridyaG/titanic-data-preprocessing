## 📊 What This Project Does

### Input: Raw Titanic Dataset
- 891 passengers
- 12 features
- 861 missing values
- Messy, unprocessed data

### Magic: Data Preprocessing Pipeline
1. Handles missing values ✓
2. Encodes categories ✓
3. Scales features ✓
4. Removes outliers ✓
5. Creates visualizations ✓

### Output: Clean Dataset
- 679 passengers (outliers removed)
- 11 features (optimized)
- 0 missing values
- **READY FOR MACHINE LEARNING!** 🎉
